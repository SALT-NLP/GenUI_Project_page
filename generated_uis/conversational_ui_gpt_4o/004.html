          <p>Sure! Imagine a neural network like a brain made up of many tiny decision-makers called
            <strong>neurons</strong>. These neurons work together to help solve problems, just like how our brain works
            when we think or make decisions.</p>
          <p>Here&#39;s a simple way to think about it:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Input Layer</strong>: This is where the network receives information. For example, if
                you&#39;re teaching the network to recognize pictures of cats, the input could be the pixels from the
                image.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Hidden Layers</strong>: After receiving the input, the neurons in the middle (called
                <strong>hidden layers</strong>) process that information by doing calculations and passing the results
                to the next layer. Each neuron looks at the data and makes a tiny decision based on the rules it has
                learned. These rules get better over time as the network practices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Output Layer</strong>: This is where the network gives its final answer. In the cat example, it
                might say &quot;Yes, this is a cat&quot; or &quot;No, this is not a cat.&quot;</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>How it learns</strong>: The network learns by comparing its answers to the correct answers (called
            <strong>labels</strong>) and adjusting itself to get better over time. This is like a teacher showing you
            the right answer, and you gradually improving your ability to solve problems.</p>
          <p>In short, a neural network is like a smart, brain-like system that gets better at tasks by learning from
            examples!</p>
