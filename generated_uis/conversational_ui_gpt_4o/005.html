          <p>A <strong>p-value</strong> in statistics is a measure used to assess the strength of evidence against the
            null hypothesis in hypothesis testing. In simpler terms, it tells you how likely it is that you would
            observe the data you collected, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis were true.</p>
          <h3>Key points about p-values:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Null Hypothesis (H₀):</strong> This is the statement you&#39;re trying to test. It often
                represents a position of no effect or no difference. For example, &quot;there is no difference between
                two groups.&quot;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):</strong> This is the opposite of the null hypothesis,
                usually stating that there is an effect or a difference.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>How p-value works:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>The p-value quantifies the likelihood of obtaining results <strong>as extreme or more
                    extreme</strong> than what you observed in your sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</li>
                <li>If the p-value is <strong>low</strong>, it suggests that the observed data is unlikely under the
                  null hypothesis, which might lead you to <strong>reject</strong> the null hypothesis.</li>
                <li>If the p-value is <strong>high</strong>, it suggests that the observed data is consistent with the
                  null hypothesis, so you would <strong>fail to reject</strong> it.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Interpreting p-values:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05):</strong> This indicates strong evidence against the null
                hypothesis. You may reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant
                effect.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Large p-value (typically &gt; 0.05):</strong> This indicates weak evidence against the null
                hypothesis, meaning you do not have enough evidence to reject it. The result is not statistically
                significant.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re testing whether a new drug is more effective than an existing one. You perform an
            experiment and get a p-value of 0.03.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you choose a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, the p-value of 0.03 is less than 0.05, so you
              <strong>reject the null hypothesis</strong> and conclude that the new drug is likely more effective than
              the existing one.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Misconceptions:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>A p-value does not tell you the probability that the null hypothesis is true.</strong> It only
              tells you how well the data you have supports or contradicts the null hypothesis.</li>
            <li><strong>A p-value is not a definitive measure of &quot;proof.&quot;</strong> It’s just an indicator of
              evidence strength. A p-value of 0.03 does not mean that the null hypothesis is false with 97% certainty—it
              just means that, if the null hypothesis were true, you would get results like the observed one (or more
              extreme) 3% of the time.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>In summary:</h3>
          <p>A p-value helps you assess whether your data provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Lower
            p-values suggest stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, while higher p-values indicate weaker
            evidence. However, it’s crucial to consider other factors like study design, sample size, and effect size
            when interpreting p-values.</p>
