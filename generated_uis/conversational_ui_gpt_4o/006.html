          <p><strong>Regression analysis</strong> is a statistical technique used to understand the relationship between
            one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to model this relationship so that
            we can make predictions or gain insights into how the dependent variable changes in response to changes in
            the independent variables.</p>
          <p>Here’s a breakdown of the main concepts involved:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Dependent Variable (Y)</strong>: This is the outcome you&#39;re trying to predict or explain.
                It&#39;s the variable that you think is influenced by other factors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Independent Variable(s) (X)</strong>: These are the predictor or explanatory variables that you
                believe might have an effect on the dependent variable. There can be one or multiple independent
                variables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Model</strong>: In simple linear regression (the most basic type), the model assumes that the
                dependent variable ( Y ) is a linear function of the independent variable(s) ( X ). Mathematically, it’s
                often expressed as:<br>[<br>Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon<br>]<br>where:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>( \beta_0 ) is the intercept (the value of ( Y ) when ( X = 0 )),</li>
                <li>( \beta_1 ) is the slope (the change in ( Y ) for a one-unit change in ( X )),</li>
                <li>( \epsilon ) is the error term (captures the variation in ( Y ) not explained by ( X )).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Simple vs. Multiple Regression</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Regression</strong> involves one independent variable (e.g., predicting sales based
                  on advertising spend).</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Regression</strong> involves two or more independent variables (e.g., predicting
                  sales based on advertising spend and product price).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Purpose</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Prediction</strong>: Once you have the regression model, you can use it to predict the
                  dependent variable ( Y ) based on new values of the independent variables ( X ).</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding Relationships</strong>: Regression helps in understanding how changes in
                  independent variables affect the dependent variable.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assumptions</strong>: For linear regression, there are several key assumptions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Linearity</strong>: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is
                  linear.</li>
                <li><strong>Independence</strong>: The residuals (errors) are independent.</li>
                <li><strong>Homoscedasticity</strong>: The variance of residuals is constant across all values of the
                  independent variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Normality</strong>: The residuals are normally distributed (mainly for inference purposes).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Evaluating the Model</strong>: Common metrics used to assess the quality of the regression
                model include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>R-squared (R²)</strong>: A measure of how well the independent variable(s) explain the
                  variability in the dependent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit.</li>
                <li><strong>P-values</strong>: Indicate whether the relationships between the independent and dependent
                  variables are statistically significant.</li>
                <li><strong>Residual plots</strong>: Help check if the assumptions of regression (like homoscedasticity)
                  hold true.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Types of Regression</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Regression</strong>: Assumes a linear relationship between the independent and
                  dependent variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Logistic Regression</strong>: Used when the dependent variable is categorical (e.g., yes/no
                  outcomes).</li>
                <li><strong>Ridge and Lasso Regression</strong>: Regularized versions of linear regression to prevent
                  overfitting by adding penalties for large coefficients.</li>
                <li><strong>Polynomial Regression</strong>: Models relationships that are curvilinear by adding
                  higher-degree terms to the model.</li>
                <li><strong>Nonlinear Regression</strong>: For relationships that can’t be captured by a straight line.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Example</strong>: Suppose you want to predict someone&#39;s salary based on their years of
            experience. In simple linear regression, you might collect data on people&#39;s experience (independent
            variable) and their salaries (dependent variable). Then, you could build a model to predict the salary given
            a specific number of years of experience.</p>
          <p>Overall, regression analysis is a powerful tool for both prediction and understanding the relationships
            between variables, and it is widely used in fields such as economics, finance, biology, engineering, and
            social sciences.</p>
