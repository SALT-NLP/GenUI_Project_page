          <p>I'm designing a mixed-methods study examining the relationship between urban green space access and
            community well-being outcomes. I plan to combine GIS spatial analysis, public health data, qualitative
            interviews, and participatory mapping workshops across neighborhoods with varying socioeconomic profiles.
            I'm concerned about integrating these different data types meaningfully and ensuring my research addresses
            environmental justice questions. What methodological framework would best support this interdisciplinary
            approach?</p>

          <p>Your study is well-aligned with a <strong>Critical Mixed-Methods</strong> or <strong>Transformative
              Mixed-Methods</strong> framework, both of which are particularly suitable for interdisciplinary,
            equity-focused research that integrates diverse data types.</p>
          <h3>Recommended Methodological Framework: <strong>Transformative Mixed-Methods Design</strong></h3>
          <p><strong>Why this fits:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Focus on social justice and equity:</strong> The Transformative paradigm explicitly aims to
              address issues of power, inequality, and marginalization—central to environmental justice.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration of qualitative and quantitative methods:</strong> It supports rigorous integration
              across methods such as GIS (quantitative spatial), public health data (quantitative), interviews
              (qualitative), and participatory mapping (qualitative/spatial).</li>
            <li><strong>Community engagement:</strong> Participatory mapping and interviews align well with
              transformative aims of co-producing knowledge with marginalized communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility in data integration:</strong> It encourages contextualization of numerical data with
              lived experiences and local knowledge, helping to interpret patterns of access and well-being through a
              justice lens.</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <h3>Integration Strategies:</h3>
          <p>To meaningfully integrate your data sources:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Sequential or Concurrent Mixed-Methods Design:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Sequential:</em> Use GIS and health data to identify disparities, then follow up with interviews
                  and participatory mapping in selected neighborhoods.</li>
                <li><em>Concurrent:</em> Collect and analyze all data types simultaneously and integrate during
                  interpretation.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Use of GIS as a Boundary Object:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Maps can serve as common ground between disciplines and participants, facilitating integration
                  between technical (spatial/public health) and experiential (qualitative) knowledge.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Joint Display Tables:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create matrices or visualizations that juxtapose quantitative findings (e.g., health outcomes by
                  green space access) with qualitative themes (e.g., perceptions of safety or access barriers).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Thematic Coding with Spatial Referencing:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Code interview and workshop data with geolocated tags or spatial identifiers to allow qualitative
                  insights to be layered onto maps.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <hr>
          <h3>Theoretical Anchors:</h3>
          <p>To reinforce your environmental justice commitment, consider embedding:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Environmental Justice Theory</strong> – to frame the analysis of distributional, procedural, and
              recognitional justice.</li>
            <li><strong>Critical GIS</strong> – to interrogate how mapping practices can both reveal and obscure power
              dynamics.</li>
            <li><strong>Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)</strong> principles – to guide participatory
              elements and ensure ethical collaboration.</li>
          </ul>
