          <p>I'm developing a comprehensive professional development program for teachers transitioning to project-based
            learning methods in STEM subjects. Many teachers have traditional training and are hesitant about shifting
            pedagogical approaches. The program needs to build both content knowledge and confidence while providing
            practical implementation strategies for diverse classroom contexts. How should I structure this training to
            address teacher concerns, provide ongoing support, and measure effectiveness?</p>

          <p>Developing a comprehensive professional development program to help teachers transition to project-based
            learning (PBL) in STEM subjects requires a thoughtful, structured approach that builds both content
            knowledge and confidence. Here’s a suggested structure for the program that addresses teacher concerns,
