        <div class="message-content">I&#039;m running a small community theater and we&#039;re stuck in the stone age -
          everything is on paper! I need some kind of website or app where people can see what plays are coming up, buy
          tickets, and maybe choose their seats? We do about 8 shows a year with 12-15 performances each. Our audience
          is mostly older folks (like 50+) but we want to attract younger people too. I have absolutely no idea how
          websites work or what&#039;s possible. My nephew mentioned something about &#039;WordPress&#039; but I
          don&#039;t know if that&#039;s right for us. We&#039;re a non-profit with very little money to spend. Oh, and
          it would be amazing if our volunteer ushers could use something on their phones to scan tickets instead of
          checking paper lists. Is this even possible? Where do I even start with this whole digital thing?</div>

          <p>Absolutely, what you’re imagining <strong>is totally possible</strong>—and it doesn’t need to break the
            bank. Many small theaters like yours have successfully moved into the digital world using low-cost,
            user-friendly tools. Let’s walk through what you need and how to get started:</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>🎭 What You Need (in simple terms):</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>A Website</strong><br>For sharing your show schedule, show descriptions, cast info, photos,
                etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Online Ticketing System</strong><br>So people can buy tickets (and maybe pick seats) online.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Digital Ticket Scanning</strong><br>So ushers can use their phones to scan tickets at the door.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <hr>
          <h3>✅ Solution Option (Simple + Affordable):</h3>
          <p>Use <strong>WordPress + a Ticketing Plugin</strong></p>
          <h4>Why WordPress?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>It’s beginner-friendly.</li>
            <li>Lots of theaters use it.</li>
            <li>Tons of free and low-cost themes.</li>
            <li>Easy to update (you or a volunteer could handle it).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Add These Tools:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Theater Schedule Plugin</strong> – Lets you post show calendars.</li>
            <li><strong>Ticketing Plugin</strong> – Like <a href="https://tickera.com/">Tickera</a>, <a
                href="https://theeventscalendar.com/products/wordpress-event-tickets/">Event Tickets</a>, or <a
                href="https://wp-eventmanager.com/">WP Event Manager</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Ticket Scanning App</strong> – Most ticketing plugins have mobile apps or web apps that
              let ushers scan QR codes with their phone cameras.</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <h3>💰 Costs (Rough Ballpark):</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Domain name</strong>: ~$15/year (e.g., yourtheater.org)</li>
            <li><strong>Hosting</strong>: $5–$15/month (SiteGround, Bluehost, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>WordPress</strong>: Free</li>
            <li><strong>Plugins</strong>: Many are free or offer nonprofit discounts; paid versions often cost
              ~$50–150/year</li>
            <li><strong>Optional help setting it up</strong>: $0 if a tech-savvy volunteer helps, $200–500 if you hire
              someone (worth it once to get it done right!)</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <h3>👩‍💻 If You’re Starting with Zero Tech Knowledge:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Get a domain name and hosting</strong> (I can help pick one).</li>
            <li><strong>Install WordPress</strong> (hosting providers usually have a “1-click install”).</li>
            <li><strong>Pick a theme</strong> – There are simple ones designed for theaters!</li>
            <li><strong>Install a ticketing plugin</strong> – Pick one that lets people choose seats and scan QR codes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Set up pages</strong> like “Home,” “Shows,” “Buy Tickets,” “About Us,” “Donate.”</li>
            <li><strong>Train your ushers</strong> (literally just using their camera or a scanning app).</li>
          </ol>
          <hr>
          <h3>🙋‍♀️ Want Even Easier? (No Website Setup)</h3>
          <p>Try these all-in-one platforms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Eventbrite</strong>: Easy ticketing + QR code scanning. No full website, but you can link to it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>OvationTix (by AudienceView)</strong> or <strong>Tix.com</strong>: Made for small theaters.</li>
            <li><strong>Ludus</strong>: Specifically built for school and community theaters. VERY easy to use, includes
              seat maps, donations, scanning, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <p>Would you like a simple comparison chart of your best options (WordPress vs Ludus vs Eventbrite, etc.)?</p>
