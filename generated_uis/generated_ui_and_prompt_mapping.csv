Many students struggle with visualizing three-dimensional molecular arrangements and understanding how they relate to chemical properties. I want to develop materials that allow students to manipulate molecular models, predict bond angles and strengths, run simulated reactions, and connect microscopic structures to macroscopic properties. My students have varying levels of spatial reasoning abilities and mathematical preparation, and I need approaches that make these abstract concepts concrete.",generative_ui_without_adaptive_reward_claude_3.7/038.html
