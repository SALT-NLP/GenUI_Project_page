                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Google's search algorithm is a complex system used to retrieve and order information from the web.
                    It's constantly evolving, with thousands of updates rolled out every year. The core goal remains
                    the same: to provide users with the most relevant and reliable results for their search queries.
                    While the exact formula is a closely guarded secret, Google has shared the fundamental steps involved.

                <h2>Step 1: Crawling</h2>
                <p>
                    The first step is <strong>crawling</strong>. Google uses automated programs called "crawlers"
                    (also known as spiders or bots) to discover new and updated web pages.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crawlers follow links from known pages to new ones.</li>
                    <li>They read the code and content of web pages.</li>
                    <li>They add the discovered pages to Google's vast index.</li>
                    <li>Website owners can control crawling using a <code>robots.txt</code> file.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This process is continuous, ensuring Google's index stays relatively fresh.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Step 2: Indexing</h2>
                <p>
                    After crawling, the next step is <strong>indexing</strong>. Google processes the pages it has
                    crawled to understand their content and organize it.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Google analyzes text content, images, videos, and other elements on the page.</li>
                    <li>It identifies keywords and concepts relevant to the page.</li>
                    <li>This information is stored in Google's index, which is like a massive digital library.</li>
                    <li>When you search on Google, you are searching this index, not the live web.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A page must be indexed to appear in search results.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Step 3: Ranking</h2>
                <p>
                    When you enter a search query, Google's algorithm performs the <strong>ranking</strong> step.
                    It sifts through the billions of pages in its index to find the most relevant ones and orders them
                    from most to least useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ranking involves hundreds of factors, often referred to as "ranking signals." Key signals include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> How well does the content match the user's query? (Keywords, concepts, freshness).</li>
                    <li><strong>Authority:</strong> How credible and trustworthy is the source? (Often measured by links from other reputable sites).</li>
                    <li><strong>Usability:</strong> Is the page easy to access and use? (Mobile-friendliness, page speed, secure connection).</li>
                    <li><strong>Context:</strong> The user's location, settings, and search history can influence results.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Google uses machine learning and artificial intelligence (like RankBrain) to interpret queries and
                    improve ranking over time.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
                <p>
                    Google constantly tests and refines its algorithm to provide better results. This includes fighting
                    spam, understanding natural language better, and adapting to new types of content and user behavior.
