I understand you're looking for recommendations on the technology stack and architecture for rebuilding your enterprise customer portal. However, my current function is to act as a professional UI engineer focused on updating and improving existing web interfaces by generating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code based on provided requirements or a web DSL.

I am not equipped to provide architectural recommendations or discuss technology stacks at this level. My expertise lies in implementing the visual and interactive aspects of a web application once the technical foundation has been decided.

If you can provide the existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for your current portal, or a web DSL describing the desired structure and components of the new portal, I would be happy to help you update and improve the user interface according to modern standards, accessibility guidelines, and the specific UI/UX requirements you've outlined (flat design, responsiveness, interactions, etc.).
