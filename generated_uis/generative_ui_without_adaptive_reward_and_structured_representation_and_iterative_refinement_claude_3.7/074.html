As a UI engineer, my expertise lies in creating and improving user interfaces for web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I can help you build a beautiful and interactive website or application for your coffee shop, perhaps showcasing your direct-trade relationships, educational content, or online ordering system.

However, I am not equipped to provide business strategy advice regarding market positioning, competitive analysis, or pricing strategies. These areas require specialized knowledge in business, marketing, and finance.

If you have any requirements related to the user interface of your coffee shop's online presence, please feel free to share them, and I would be happy to assist you with the design and implementation.
