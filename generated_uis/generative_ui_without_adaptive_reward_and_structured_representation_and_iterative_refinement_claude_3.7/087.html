I understand you're looking for guidance on integrating quantitative and qualitative data for your dissertation. However, my expertise is in web development, specifically updating and improving user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am not equipped to provide advice on research methodologies or data analysis techniques for academic work.

For assistance with synthesizing your mixed-methods data, I recommend consulting your dissertation advisor, a research methods expert, or academic resources specializing in mixed-methods research designs.
